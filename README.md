# TinyRendererView
This project uses the [TinyRenderer](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer) as a DLL.

I wanted to build this application to make it quicker and easier to see the output of following the TinyRenderer guide.

It will also serve as a simple OBJ model loader and viewer after it is complete.

What I have learnt along the way:

```
- Various parts of softawre rendering, including: how models are OBJ stored, basic rasterising and transforms.
- Memory management in C++.
- How to create a DLL for windows systems in C++.
- How to use a DLL from a C# WPF app and how to handle managed vs native memory.
- How to convert from RGB byte values to an image to display.
```
